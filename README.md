# Huffman Compression

Huffman compression is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This allows for efficient encoding of data, resulting in reduced file sizes.

It is an efficient technique for reducing the size of data without losing any information. It is widely used in various applications, including file compression and data transmission.

## How Huffman Compression Works

### 1. Frequency Analysis
   - The first step in Huffman compression is to analyze the input data and determine the frequency of each character.
   - Characters with higher frequencies will be assigned shorter codes in the final compressed data.

### 2. Building the Huffman Tree
   - Once the frequencies of characters are determined, a Huffman tree is constructed.
   - The tree is built in a way that characters with higher frequencies are closer to the root, and characters with lower frequencies are farther away.

### 3. Generating Huffman Codes
   - Huffman codes are generated by traversing the Huffman tree.
   - Left branches represent "0" and right branches represent "1".
   - Each character is assigned a unique binary code based on its position in the tree.

### 4. Encoding Data
   - The input data is then encoded using the generated Huffman codes.
   - Each character in the input data is replaced with its corresponding Huffman code.

### 5. Compression
   - Finally, the encoded data is written to a file.
   - Since shorter codes are assigned to more frequent characters, the resulting compressed file size is smaller than the original data.

## Example

Suppose we have the following input data:

```
Input: "aaabbbcc"
```

1. Frequency Analysis:

   - Frequency of 'a': 3
   - Frequency of 'b': 3
   - Frequency of 'c': 2

2. Building the Huffman Tree:

   ```
      (root)
      /   \
     a     (bc)
          /   \
         b     c
   ```

3. Generating Huffman Codes:

   - 'a': 0
   - 'b': 10
   - 'c': 11

4. Encoding Data:

   Original: "aaabbbcc"
   Encoded: "00011101010111"

5. Compression:

   The compressed data "00011101010111" is smaller in size compared to the original data.

## Usage

To compress a file using Huffman compression:

```bash
$ huffman compress input.txt output.huf
```

To decompress a file:

```bash
$ huffman decompress input.huf output.txt
```
